description: Overview This project was completed as part of an embedded systems course at Northwestern University. In this project computer vision and machine learning were used with a Baxter robot in order to get Baxter to pick up a desired box with a hand written number on it. <br><br><h3>Computer vision</h3> In order to have Baxter recognize the numbers some computer vision was required. this involved using a USB camera and openCv to isolate the numbers from the frame and then convert them to a the MNIST number format (Black background, white number, 28x28 pixels) that the machine learning algorithms were trained on. <br><br> <h3>Machine learning</h3> Multiple machine learning techniques were used for the classification of the numbers. These included Convolutional neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and combinational one vs all linear classifiers. These algorithms were written from scratch with the exception of the Convolutional neural network which was created using Keras. <br><br> The final algorithm that was implemented was the written from scratch multiple one vs all classifier, it was the quickest and it inherently calculated confidence values for each prediction. To improve the accuracy of the predictions the highest confidence predictions were selected first and the number that was predicted was removed from the "prediction pool" (that number could not be predicted again). This meant that each number could only come up once (as each number was only present on the table once) and that these numbers were predicted in order of confidence levels. This resulted in a very robust prediction strategy that in practice classified all ten numbers on the table correctly every time. <br><br> <h3>Baxter and ROS</h3> This project involved using a Baxter robot made by Rethink robotics. Interfacing with Baxter as well as the USB camera were done using ROS. Ros was also used for all of the data transfer between various subsystems that were required to get this project to work. <br> <br><div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mBMQKgL1O9M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <br><br> To see more you can visit <a href="https://github.com/sohn21c/BaxterReadsNumbers">Baxter reads numbers</a>
