description: <h3>Overview</h3> This project aimed to develop a gait for a quadrupedal robot with the use of machine learning. In particular a robot model was created in gazebo and evolutionary algorithms were used to develop a gait. The gait developed is then intended to be put onto a 3d printed robot of the same shape and size. The motivation for this project was to see if a gait could be developed for a robot without delving into the inverse kinematics and other mathematical models of the system, as such the algorithm only has control over evolving the positions of the servo motors in the joints of the robot. <br> <br> <h3>Gazebo and ROS</h3>This project makes use of gazebo for the simulation of the robot and its gait evolution. Gazebo is used in conjunction with ROS to spawn a robot, control its joints and receive information about how the model performed in gazebo. This involves the use of plugins to control the model and reading topics to determine how the model is performing in the simulation<h3>Hardware</h3>The hardware part of this project involves the implementation of the gait onto a 3D printed version of the robot. The robot runs off a raspberry pi zero with a servo driver board. The 3D printed model is actuated with 12 servo motors<br><br> <h3>Algorithms</h3> This project makes use of hand written evolutionary algorithms to develop the gait of the robot. Multiple variations of 'genetic encodings' and fitness functions have been explored to determine which combination produces the best gait in terns of speed and stability. A further goal of this project would be to try reinforcement learning algorithms on the framework that has been set up for simulation and machine learning <br><br> Two different genetic encodings were used:<br> The first encoding was a list of joint angles for all the joints combined. This encoding took the form of [hip1 angle at t0, hip2 angle at t0, .... ankle3 angle at t0, ankle4 angle at t0, hip0 angle at t1 ...] <br> The second encoding a list of joint angles for a single leg and a list of phases to offset the angles for the other legs. This encoding took the form of [hip angle at t0, knee angle at t0, ankle angle at t0, hip angle at t1, knee angle at t1 ...] and [offset for leg 2, offset for leg 3, offset for leg 4] <br> As with other evolutionary algorithms this algorithm makes use of mutations, mating between the surviving members of the population and culling of the weak portion of the population at each generation. <br>  <div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/98T7DQ4kf7k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>To see more you can visit <a href="https://github.com/robo-jordo/quadruped_ml_gait">Quadrupedal ML gait</a>
