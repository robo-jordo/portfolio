description: <h3>Overview</h3> This project was developed as a final deliverable for a course to build and program a quadrotor at Northwestern University.  <br> <br> <h3>Low level controller</h3>A PID controller was implemented using IMU data in order to stabilize the quad-rotor for human controlled flight. The IMU data was processed to provide pitch roll and yaw information. Both the accelerometer and gyroscope data were used with an exponential filter in order to get low noise low drift data.<br><br><h3>High level controller</h3> A high level PID controller was then implemented with VIVE sensor data, this Controller was used to control the position of the quad-rotor for autonomous flight.<br><br> <h3>Future application</h3> As a future proposed project I would like to make a few of these raspberry pi powered quadcopters for use with ROS. <br><br> <div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4YWX9Jbwsrs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
