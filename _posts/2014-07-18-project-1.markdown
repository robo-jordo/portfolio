description: <h3>Overview</h3> This project aimed to develop a gait for a quadrupedal robot with the use of machine learning. In particular a robot model was created in gazebo and evolutionary algorithms were used to develop a gait. The gait developed is then inteded to be put onto a 3d printed robot of the same shape and size. The motivation for this project was to see if a gait could be developed for a robot without delving into the inverse kinematics and other mathematical models of the system, as such the algorithm only has control over evolving the positions of the servo motors in the joints of the robot. <br> <br> This project is still being developed. <h3>Gazebo and ROS</h3>This project makes use of gazebo for the simulation of the robot and its gait evolution. Gazebo is used in conjunction with ROS to spawn a robot, control its joints and receive information about how the model performed in gazebo. This involves the use of plugins to control the model and reading topics to determine how the model is performing in the simulation <h3>Algorithms</h3> This project makes use of hand written evolutionary algorithms to develop the gait of the robot. Multiple variations of 'genetic encodings' and fitness functions have been explored to determine which combination produces the best gait in terns of speed and stability. A further goal of this project would be to try reinforcement learning algorithms on the framework that has been set up for simulation and machine learning <h3>Hardware</h3>The hardware part of this project is still in progress. this will involve the implementation of the gait onto a 3D printed version of the robot, running off a raspberry pi zero. The 3D printed model is actuated with 12 servo motors<br> <br> To see more you can visit <a href="https://github.com/robo-jordo/quadruped_ml_gait">Quadrupedal ML gait</a>
