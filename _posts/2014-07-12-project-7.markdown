description: <h3>Overview</h3>This project was completed as a project requirement during third year at the University of cape Town. This project was completed by a team of 5 students. My main responsibilities were the circuits and micro controller portions, which I collaborated with one other student to complete. The final robot was a line following legged robot,that could detect whether a start light was green or red and could detect objects in front of it with millimeter precision.<br><br><h3>Circuits</h3>All the circuits were designed and built from discrete analogue components and assembled on vero-boards. The only exception to this, was the H-bridge for which we purchased packaged a chip on a PCB for size reasons. The circuits included, An H-bridge circuit, A color light detection circuit (using filtered photo-resistors), a line sensing circuit (using an array of 5 IR sensors), a distance sensor (using an IR sensor).<br><br><h3>Mechanics</h3>The system had to be legged, as such the solution implemented was a Jansen linkage. This allowed for the robot to move each set of legs with only one DC motor<br><br><h3>Micro controller</h3>The micro controller used was a STM32F051C6. Prototyping was done on a PCB development board created as part of another course at the University of Cape Town. The final micro controller circuitry was also soldered onto a vero-board. All the micro controller code was developed in C and compiled appropriately using atollic rather than gcc.<br><div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jh0jbvVAkj8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
